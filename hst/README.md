## BR class 43 'HST' mod for the Advtrains mod ##

This mod adds a power car and carriages that are based off the British Rail class 43, a high-speed train build in England between 1975 to 1982. It is officially the fastest diesel train in the world. Many are still in service today (I think). The sets are comprised of between 2+5 and 2+9 cars, with 2+5 being the shortest allowed due to braking issues.



# notes

Due to the length of the wagons, you will have to go into third person view to exit the power car (key 'c' by default in minetest 5.3+, otherwise F7). Sorry about that.

The real maximum speed of the HST is 125mph, or 201km/h (hence the name 'intercity 125'), however, the maximum speed that Advtrains supports is 72km/h.

As I was so focused in getting the shape of the train correct, when I scaled the train to match the rails, the body ended up being a bit small - I reccomend using the low platforms in Advtrains.












note: class43, HST, Intercity125 - I treat them all as the same thing. In reality, I think the class 43 refers to the power cars themselves or something, but I'm not sure.
